    Args:
        hostname (str):
            The hostname or IP address of the network device being logged into

        profile (str):
            The profile is a prefix for the user provided .env file which is loaded
            and read by the third-party library python-dotenv.  The load_dotenv()
            method is initialized as part of the class init.

            This allows for flexibility for when one may work in different environments
            where SSH login credentials may be different.  For example, testing,
            production, etc.

            This assumes the .env file has been written so that all credentials are written
            in a uniform manner using a uniform prefix to uniquely identify the environment

            Example: testing_username, testing_password, testing_secret

            In this case, the user would set the profile argument to "testing"

        platform (str):
            The Netmiko platform being connected to.  Can be cisco_ios for IOS
            devices, cisco_nxos for Nexus devices, cisco_telnet for when using
            Telnet, etc.
